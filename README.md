To Do List App Project Requirements
Introduction

The To Do List App is a simple and easy-to-use application that helps you keep track of all your tasks. You can create new tasks, edit them, delete them, and change their status to active, complete, or incomplete. This app also shows you how many tasks you have completed, how many are still active, and how many are incomplete. The app displays a progress report so you can see how well you are doing with your tasks.
Features
Task Managment

    Creating Tasks:
        You can add new tasks to your list.
        Each task will have a title, a description, the date it was created, and the date or time by which it should be completed.

    Editing Tasks:
        You can make changes to the tasks if needed.
        You can update the title, description, and completion date.

    Deleting Tasks:
        You can remove tasks that you no longer need.
        Deleting a task will remove it from your list completely.

    Setting Task Status:
        Each task can be marked as active, complete, or incomplete.
        Active tasks are the ones you are currently working on.
        Complete tasks are those you have finished.
        Incomplete tasks are the ones you haven't started yet or need more work.

Progress Tracking

    Task Ratios:
        The app will show you how many tasks are complete, how many are active, and how many are incomplete.
        You will see this information as a simple progress report.

    Progress Display:
        You can see a visual representation (like a pie chart or a progress bar) showing the ratio of complete, active, and incomplete tasks.
        This helps you understand how much work you have done and how much is left.

Task Details

    Title:
        A short name for your task so you can quickly understand what it is about.

    Description:
        More details about what you need to do for the task.

    Date of Creation:
        The date when you added the task to your list.

    Completion Date:
        The date or time by which you should finish the task.
        This helps you manage your time and meet deadlines.

By using the To Do List App, you can organize your tasks, keep track of your progress, and ensure that nothing important is forgotten.
